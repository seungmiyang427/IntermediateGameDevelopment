For this midterm, I decided to make a clone of the Village Bridge in Pokemon Black/White. This game is my childhood game and is by far one of my all-time favorites- to put it short, it has a very special place in my heart. Village Bridge is one of the towns that I specifically remember enjoying- it has such a unique vibe (and story too honestly) to it! I especially loved interacting with NPCs to add instruments to the background music; it blew my mind at the time. I definitely wanted to include that in my clone. There was also a sandwich shop minigame I loved playing there, and while I really want to include that as well, I feel like I won't have enough time for it sadly :( but who knows, maybe I will? So far whenever I plan things out in terms of scope/time and then work on it, it either takes like a couple minutes or a couple hours to figure out... so, very unpredictable stuff.

Anyways, to go about cloning Pokemon, I looked up a complete walkthrough tutorial online for making a Pokemon game on Unity 2D, and followed along with the parts that I wanted to include. I was thinking of adding my own stuff to my clone, but would that even be a clone at that point?
