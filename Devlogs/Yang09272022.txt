-Discuss your process of working on your Rube Goldberg machine!

This was honestly a really painful process lol. To start things off, I had to look up a Youtube tutorial because I still couldn't really get the whole physics thing through my head. Actually, it was pretty helpful so I'm not mad. But the actual project itself. Ohhh man. I hated how trial-and-error-esque it was, especially considering I had no idea what I was really doing until near the end. Pressing play and waiting until I finally got to the part I wanted to see was one thing, but the fact that the whole project didn't work because something was juuuust a few centimeters off... oh man that was frustrating. Once I got everything working though, coloring and doing that particle effect (I looked up a tutorial but ended up playing with it until I got what I wanted) at the end was seamless and fun. 

As for the WebGL build... I think I broke like literally everything trying to get it to work. So... I'm gonna need to get some help with that...
