I actually really liked this project. First of all, it was an absolute pleasure working with Tommy and Charlie- we already knew each other from last year but it was nice to get closer by working together. Everyone pulled their own weight and things went relatively smooth, to my surprise. I mean, I honestly thought I would mess something up on GitHub (like last year’s incident where I literally broke a group project… oops), but I actually got the hang of it this time and it isn’t so scary to me anymore! And I can say the same for coding too- I started to actually connect the dots from all the tutorials I looked at this semester, and things finally clicked for me (mostly variable assigning and referencing, which I know is very basic but I had tons of trouble grasping and applying). I really appreciated this class and having you as a professor; I actually don’t hate coding anymore and find it fun now, and I owe a lot of it to your patience and willingness to always help.

As for my process and contributions- I first started with establishing the basic code for registering damage, and I also set a very prototype version of the game scene for us to work with. I then went off to focus on the UI/different scenes, since that was my main job. I had some trouble with coding points and the pause screen- I had to account for a lot of things at once (i.e when I paused the game, it also paused the cutscene animation in the other scene, so I had to include the same code in the cutscene, and resume it there) and that was quite... frustrating. But not too frustrating! I got it working at some point, and it felt very rewarding. Once I was done with that, I helped with getting the obstacles objects set up, and a few bug fixes here and there!
