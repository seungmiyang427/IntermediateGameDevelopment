-Which industry role(s) sound the best and/or worst to you? Are you even sure you want to work within the industry? What else would you be interested in doing?
	As of right now, being a 3D Artist (whether that's character or environment... I'm not too sure yet) piques my interest. Though honestly, I really like designing UIs as well. So I'm a little torn between the two... Hopefully my time here at the Game Center can help me decide what I want to specialize in more. I definitely want to work within the industry- more specifically, I want to work for big companies/titles. So far that's what I have my eyes set on, but who knows what might happen in the future?

-Which role(s) was surprising, easy, hard, cheap, expensive, or __?
	UI Design was surprising to me in that I never really thought I would be interested in it. Well, that was until last year's Intro to Visual Communications class, where I redesigned the HUD for one of all-time my favorite games, Warframe. It was a blast to work on, and I really enjoyed both the process and the result (which is a rare occurrence for me). Overall, the assignment was so fun that it didn't feel like schoolwork to me. And that really hit home, since my dream job is to do something I genuinely enjoy doing... while making bank at the same time.
	I haven't had much experience with 3D Art yet. Like, I literally have no idea what's going on every time I try to learn it. And I have a loooot to learn. At least for UI Design, I have prior experience in Photoshop and well, 2D art to effectively illustrate my ideas. But 3D Art? It's basically starting from scratch, facing the big, scary unknown. And honestly, that's kind of intimidating to me. But at the same time, 3D Art is really cool, and I bet it's really rewarding and fun once I get the hang of it.
